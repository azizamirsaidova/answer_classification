Answer type prediction aims to identify the types of answer results to filter out irrelevant results which particularly improves QA systems. Answers categorized into boolean (true/false), numeric and string data types.

### **Two stage workflow**
1. Multi-class classification that predicts the answer category of the question -  (boolean, number, string, date, and resource) by fine-tuning BERT classifier. 

2. BERT Classifier applied to predict the general types for each question in resource category.
